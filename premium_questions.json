      "questionText": "If all birds can fly and penguins are birds, but penguins cannot fly, which statement must be true?",
      "options": [
        "Penguins are not actually birds",
        "The statement 'all birds can fly' is false",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "This creates a logical contradiction. If all birds can fly AND penguins are birds, then penguins should be able to fly. But they can't, so there's a contradiction in the premises.",
